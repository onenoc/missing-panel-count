# A Robust Functional EM Algorithm for Incomplete Panel Count Data.
This is a repository for the paper A Robust Functional EM Algorithm for Incomplete Panel Count Data, which is to appear at Neurips 2020. We include code for the bladder tumor and synthetic experiments, but not for the smoking cessation experiment, which we are not currently permitted to share.
